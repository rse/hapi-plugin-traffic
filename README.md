About
-----

This is a small plugin for the [HAPI](http://hapijs.com/) server
framework for accounting the network traffic per request (received/sent
payload/raw data plus the start/finish time and duration).

ATTENTION: The information about the network traffic is not 100%
precise, as this plugin has has to partially estimate the numbers
`recvRaw` (because HAPI comes too late and hence the HTTP headers have
to be re-constructed) and `sentPayload` (because in case of Boom error
responses the JSON serialization has to be pre-constructed). Hence, the
information is precise enough for the usual logging purposes, but do not
use at least the partially estimated numbers `recvRaw` and `sentPayload`
for realistic accounting purposes.

Usage
-----

```js
await server.register(require("hapi-plugin-traffic"))
[...]
server.events.on("tail", (request) => {
    let traffic = request.traffic()
    console.log(
        `recv=${traffic.recvPayload}/${traffic.recvRaw} ` +
        `sent=${traffic.sentPayload}/${traffic.sentRaw} ` +
        `start=${new Date(traffic.timeStart)} ` +
        `finish=${new Date(traffic.timeFinish)} ` +
        `duration=${traffic.timeDuration}ms`
    )
})
```
